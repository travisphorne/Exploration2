So, I decided to set up node.js and learn how to use it for my exploration. I used my windows machine instead of my linux machine for extra funzies.

The links I used:
http://nodeguide.com/beginner.html
http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.4/api/globals.html
http://nodejs.org/download/

I mostly just did some simple hello world apps to test it and play around with it. So far I think node.js is really interesting and I'll probably put it to use soon. I've been meaning to get further into javascript anyways and this gives me a legitimate excuse. It's pretty cool that node allows you to set up a basic windows machine as a webserver with just one installation.

Problem I had:
(Error: ENOENT, stat 'C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\npm') 

	I googled it and found that the fix was simple, I just had to manually create a file named "npm"
	in the directory displayed. I did that and it worked perfectly. 
	
Problem 2:
I couldn't run files ouside of the nodejs directory. So I had to create a new system variable for node.
